## Simple Regression

This section focuses on implementing a simple regression model using quadratic equations and optimizing it with PyTorch.

- **Function Creation:** Define the target function as `target = Ax² + Bx + C` and the prediction function as `predict = A'x² + B'x + C'`.
- **Loss Function:** Implement the Mean Squared Error (MSE) Loss as `MSELoss = 0.5 * (target - predict)²`.
- **Regression with PyTorch:** Utilize the PyTorch API to minimize the loss and make the prediction as close as possible to the target.

## LeNet-5 with MNIST

In this section, we implement and train the LeNet-5 neural network using the MNIST dataset.

- **Neural Network Creation:** Construct the LeNet-5 architecture using PyTorch API.
- **Training:** Train the network using the MNIST dataset.
- **Testing:** Evaluate the training results and model performance.

## Custom Dataset

Working with a custom dataset, training models like VGG-16 or ResNet18.

- **Dataset Access:** Load and preprocess the custom dataset using PyTorch API.
- **Model Training:** Train models like VGG-16 or ResNet18 on the custom dataset.
